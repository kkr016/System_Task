## A task from VirtualMaze Softsys Pvt. Ltd

The Python program that generates a rectangle with given coordinates, generates N random points in 2D space, divides the rectangle into 8 equal sections, counts the number of random points that lie in each section, and calculates the probability of the points falling into each section.

## Here's a brief overview of the program and its functionality:

* Import the necessary libraries: Matplotlib and random.

* Take input for the four coordinates of the rectangle.

* Plot the coordinate points using the Matplotlib library.

* Generate N random floating points in 2D space using the random library.

* Divide the rectangle into 8 equal sections.

* Count the number of random points that lie in each section.

* Calculate the probability of the points falling into each section.

* Output the counts and probabilities for each section.

## The program consists of several functions that perform the following tasks:

   * The "show" function is used to plot the rectangle and points using the Matplotlib library.

   * The "create_sections" function is used to divide the rectangle into 8 equal sections by calculating the boundaries of each section based on the size of the rectangle.

   * The "count_points_in_sections" function is used to count the number of random points that fall within each section of the rectangle.

   * The "calculate_probabilities" function is used to calculate the probability of the points falling into each section.

The program then calls these functions in a specific order to generate the desired output
